# Wordpress Starter Theme

## Work in progress

The perfect simple starter theme for me.
Lightweight starter WP with SCSS + SCMACSS/ES6/Gulp/Bootstrap (or Foundation).

Extra features:

Owl Carousel. The best slider imo. Linghtweight and good looking when animated.

## Installation

Unzip the file in your wp-content/themes/

### Gulp Installation

### Install Sass

Go to [sass-lang.com/install](http://sass-lang.com/install) for installation in command line.

## Gulp Tasks
